## CatRPG Multimedia Database API

This project is a FastAPI-based RESTful API for uploading and storing multimedia game assets (sprites, audio files, and player scores) in a MongoDB Atlas database. Developed as part of the Database Essentials unit at MCAST.


## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.11**
- **FastAPI** â€“ High-performance API framework
- **Uvicorn** â€“ ASGI server to run FastAPI
- **Motor** â€“ Asynchronous MongoDB driver
- **Pymongo** â€“ Core MongoDB Python driver (used by Motor)
- **Pydantic v2** â€“ Data validation and type enforcement
- **Python-Multipart** â€“ To handle file uploads via Postman
- **Python-Dotenv** â€“ To manage environment variables (if used)
- **Requests** â€“ For making HTTP requests (optional usage)
- **MongoDB Atlas** â€“ Cloud NoSQL database
- **Postman** â€“ For testing your API
- **VS Code** â€“ Development environment



## How I set up the environment
This section outlines how I set up my development environment for this project.

### 1. Created a Project Folder
I created a folder named `catgame_api` to store all the project files.

### 2. Opened VS Code
I opened the folder in Visual Studio Code, which I used as my code editor throughout the assignment.

### 3. Created a Virtual Environment
I opened the terminal in VS Code and ran:
python -m venv env

### 4. Activated the Virtual Environment
In the terminal, I activated the environment using:
.\env\Scripts\activate   

### 5. Installed all required Python packages using pip:
pip install fastapi uvicorn motor pydantic python-dotenv python-multipart requests

### 5. Created requirements.txt
I saved my dependencies by running:
pip freeze > requirements.txt

### 6. Created My Main File
main.py â€“ where all the FastAPI endpoints are



## Running the API Locally

Once your virtual environment and dependencies are ready, run the FastAPI server using:
uvicorn main:app --reload
This will start the API at:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
You can test and view the endpoints using the built-in Swagger UI at that URL.

API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint          | Description                            |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/upload_sprites` | Upload one or more sprite images       |
| POST   | `/upload_audios`  | Upload one or more audio files         |
| POST   | `/upload_scores`  | Submit one or more player scores       |

All endpoints return JSON responses with confirmation messages and inserted MongoDB IDs.
